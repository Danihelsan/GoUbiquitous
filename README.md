# GoUbiquitous
Sixth project from Udacity Nanodegree

For this project, I've used the Android Studio Wizard to create the Watch Face module.
The mobile module was replaced by the Sunshine module and packages were updated.

Most of the mobile module modifications are in the SunshineSycAdapter class,
which is in charge of obtain the new weather status periodically.

Remember to add the WeatherMap ApiKey into the gradle.properties file.
